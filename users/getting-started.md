# Getting started

A good start is to fork the project and look at the CLI options:

``` bash
$ ./imapfw.py -h
```

The main argument is the `ACTION`. It tells what imapfw must do. I've started the implementation of the most expected feature: `syncAccounts`. For now, it won't sync anything and you can run it safely.
